To Do References:
TimerUiController.cs
- Replace Input logic with new Input System
- Remove ownership of the timer from the Ui controller and give it to the GameplaySession.cs
- Move formatting logic to a string utility script
SrsUiController.cs
- Use the timer string utility to format the best and average times
- Format the due date in order to show "due" if the next time is past
- Format the due date in a shorter easily readable string
- Change the streak label between "Success/Failure streak" based on the value of the SrsLayoutData's last result

General List: (in order of priority)

Spaced Repetition System:
- Learning center Ui
- - Due window
- - Upcoming Window
- - Disabled Window
- - Burned Window
- - All Window
- - Show/Hide entries
- - Play random due entry
- - Select entry without automatically playing
- - - Show statistics
- - - Enable/Disable toggle

Replace Manifest and Folder Logic:
- Move shipped layouts out of Streaming Assets in order to be able to compress at build time and utilize Unity's faster loading pipeline
- Ship app with a layout for each graph
- Remove DGRs and TGRs
- Replace the manifest for shipped layouts with an asset database
- Utilize scriptable objects for the asset database
- Asset database structure:
- - Act
- - - Id
- - - Display Name
- - - Area
- - - - Id
- - - - Display Name
- - - - Custom Thumbnail
- - - - DGR/TGR[]
- - - - - Id
- - - - - Display Name
- - - - - DGR/TGR Render Thumbnail
- - - - - Layout[]
- - - - - - Id
- - - - - - Display Name
- - - - - - Cropped and Normalized Size Layout PNG
- - - - - - Pre-Computed Collision Map
- Utilize Asset database structure to build paths for user imported screenshots
- - Use Ids as folder names E.g. act_1 -> .../act_1/
- - Use Persistent Data Path for user imported layouts (Read/Write) instead of Streaming Assets
- Create a node editor which allows users to add, remove and modify nodes to a layout
- - Implement node sequencing for the pathfinding algorithm
- - Implement node type
- - - Checkpoint, entrance, other?
- - Save data to the collision map scriptable object when in editor
- - Save data to a serialized object (same structure as the scriptable object) when using the node editor at runtime
- Look into Addressables

Collisions:
- Once CivilianLP's tool is ready, implement play collisions
- Add collision boolean to player settings to make collisions optional
- Modify fog shader to only apply edge colour to the walkable grid cells of the collision map

Player Path:
- Calculate the distance traveled of the player from time start to time end
- Display traveled distance in real time
- Display traveled path when prompted by the player

Triggers:
- Add node detection as part of the player collision logic in order to fire events when in a given radius of a node
- Add interaction input which can be triggered when in the radius of a node
- Add node types
- - Entrance
- - Checkpoint

Checkpoints:
- Add Ui which replicates the in game Ui for checkpoint teleportation
- Implement logic to allow users to teleport from and to any visited checkpoint

Layout Browser:
- Area Buttons Ui Prefab
- Graph Buttons Ui Prefab
- Layout Buttons Ui Prefab

Inputs
- Switch to new input system
- Review old input code
- - Replace with new input system logic
- - Move to different scripts if necessary

Data Persistence:
- Layout Params File
- - Layout Params Service

Layout Parameters:
- Load parameters on startup
- Display name
- - Update learning center and layout browser names based on layout params
- Filtering
- - Implement Ui and logic for filtering layouts based on their custom flags
- Params settings menu
- - Create settings Ui for modifying a target layout's parameters
- - Save on apply
- - Open the menu upon selecting a layout in the layout nav window of the layout browser

Mobile Refactoring:
- Define what is needed to support Android
