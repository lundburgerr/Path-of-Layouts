In Game Layout Display:
- Add an option to show the DGR name
- Add an option to show the Layout name

Cached Gameplay Entry Behaviour:
- Disable the button if the initial behaviour was "Target layout" since this would effectively be the same as the replay button

Data Persistence:
- Layout Params File
- - Layout Params Service
- Gameplay Settings File
- - Gameplay Settings Service

Spaced Repetition System:
- Learning center Ui
- - Due window
- - Upcoming Window
- - Disabled Window
- - Burnt Window
- - All Window
- Success and failure conditions
- - Gameplay Ui
- - Gameplay inputs

Layout Parameters:
- Load parameters on startup
- Display name
- - Update learning center and layout browser names based on layout params
- Filtering
- - Implement Ui and logic for filtering layouts based on their custom flags
- Params settings menu
- - Create settings Ui for modifying a target layout's parameters
- - Save on apply
- - Open the menu upon selecting a layout in the layout nav window of the layout browser

Shader Rewrite:
- Current fog and fog stamp shaders aren't compatible when building the client
- Must read on Unity shader structure in order to rewrite them

Triggers:
- Add node detection as part of the player collision logic in order to fire events when in a given radius of a node
- Add interaction input which can be triggered when in the radius of a node
- Add node types
- - Entrance
- - Checkpoint

Checkpoints:
- Add Ui which replicates the in game Ui for checkpoint teleportation
- Implement logic to allow users to teleport from and to any visited checkpoint

Player Path:
- Calculate the distance traveled of the player from time start to time end
- Display traveled distance in real time
- Display traveled path when prompted by the player

Layout Browser:
- Area Container Ui
- Area Buttons Ui Prefab
- Graph Container Ui
- Graph Buttons Ui Prefab
- Layout Container Ui
- Layout Buttons Ui Prefab

Collisions:
- Once CivilianLP's tool is ready, implement play collisions
- Add collision boolean to player settings to make collisions optional
- Modify fog shader to only apply edge colour to the walkable grid cells of the collision map

Mobile Refactoring:
- Define what is needed to support Android

Brainstorm:
- How to make it possible to link one graph's entrance node to another graph's
- Should we somehow start using the graph data
- How to define what is the starting and ending node
- Should collision maps be computed once and saved to file
- Should collision maps be computed by an external tool and saved to a unique extension instead of as PNG data
- - This would avoid the need to png loading, compressing and resizing
- - This would avoid the need to compute the collision map at runtime
- - This could allow users to define their node path and node behaviour and save it to the collision map file
